# *Statistical modelling for predicting football outcomes*
This repository contains an R implementation of my BSc thesis in Statistics (University of Trieste)

Some information about the following R scripts:
- `data_preparation.R` : feature selection from the original dataset
- `home_effect.R : script to show an empirical proof of a home effect in football`
- `Maher_parameters_estimation.R` : script to estimate Maher model's optimal parameters
