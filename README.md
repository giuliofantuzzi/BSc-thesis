# *Statistical modelling for predicting football outcomes*
This repository contains an R implementation of my BSc thesis in Statistics (University of Trieste)

Some information about the following R scripts:
- `poisson_approximation.R` : analysis of Poisson as an approximation for Teams's Goals
- `home_effect.R` : an empirical proof of a home effect in football
- `Maher_parameters_estimation.R` : estimation of Maher model's optimal parameters
