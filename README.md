# Statistical modelling for predicting football outcomes
## An R implementation of the Dixon-Coles model and applications to the 2021-2022 serie A championship 

This repository contains an R implementation of my BSc thesis in Statistics (University of Trieste)

Some information about the following R scripts:
- `poisson_approximation.R` : analysis of Poisson as an approximation for Teams's Goals
- `home_effect.R` : an empirical proof of a home effect in football
- `Maher_parameters_estimation.R` : estimation of Maher model's optimal parameters (using all season matches as training-set)
- `DC_static_parameters_estimation.R` : estimation of Dixon-Coles static model's optimal parameters (using all season matches as training-set)
- `DC_dinamic_parameters_estimation.R` : estimation of Dixon-Coles dinamic model's optimal parameters (over the 2nd half of the season)
